Markdown theme packs best practices begin with clear source discipline. Writers should keep the Markdown readable in raw form, use stable heading structure, and avoid workflow assumptions that only make sense inside one private application shell.

Theme packs separate visual identity from content structure and rendering behavior. Teams usually get better results when preview behavior, file ownership, storage expectations, and publishing boundaries are explicit instead of implied.

A good Markdown theme packs workflow also separates durable content from presentation-specific behavior. That makes it easier to review the source, move it between tools, and keep documentation or package adoption paths aligned with the same content.

Within MdWrk, those best-practice ideas map cleanly to local-first authoring, reusable renderer and editor packages, documented theme and extension surfaces, and proof-oriented public documentation.
