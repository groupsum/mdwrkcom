faqs:
  - question: "Why does Markdown theme packs matter for developers?"
    answer: "It matters when developers need Markdown that stays readable in Git, works with review flows, and can be rendered or reused through packages and publishing systems."
  - question: "What should developers look for in Markdown theme packs?"
    answer: "Developers usually look for plain-text durability, predictable rendering, repository-friendly review paths, and reusable tooling around the Markdown source."

Markdown theme packs for developers is different from general writing guidance because the workflow usually sits close to code, repositories, build output, or package-level reuse.

Theme packs separate visual identity from content structure and rendering behavior. Developers usually care about reviewability, predictable rendering, version control, and whether the Markdown behavior can be shared across applications instead of living inside one private editor.

Markdown theme-pack work matters when teams need consistent styling across editor, preview, and public lander surfaces without patching internals. That is why package surfaces, renderer contracts, and explicit publishing boundaries matter so much in Markdown-heavy developer environments.

MdWrk connects well to this perspective because it treats Markdown as durable source while exposing renderer, editor, theme, extension, lander, and content-pack surfaces separately.
