A Markdown extension workflows workflow usually starts with plain-text authoring and then moves into preview, review, and output-specific steps. Extension-oriented workflows that add commands, panes, integrations, or automation around Markdown.

Markdown extension work is easier to scale when commands, settings, and runtime behavior are documented and reusable. What matters most is that the team can explain where the Markdown source lives, how rendered output is checked, who reviews it, and when the content moves into another system such as a site build, repository, or package surface.

Good workflow design keeps those boundaries explicit. That helps teams avoid mixing local drafting, hosted collaboration, and final publishing into one opaque step.

MdWrk supports this kind of workflow framing by keeping Markdown central while exposing feature routes, package routes, compare pages, and proof pages that document the surrounding behavior.
