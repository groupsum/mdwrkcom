faqs:
  - question: "Why does Markdown extension workflows matter for developers?"
    answer: "It matters when developers need Markdown that stays readable in Git, works with review flows, and can be rendered or reused through packages and publishing systems."
  - question: "What should developers look for in Markdown extension workflows?"
    answer: "Developers usually look for plain-text durability, predictable rendering, repository-friendly review paths, and reusable tooling around the Markdown source."

Markdown extension workflows for developers is different from general writing guidance because the workflow usually sits close to code, repositories, build output, or package-level reuse.

Extension workflows matter when teams want customization without turning every Markdown behavior into app-local code. Developers usually care about reviewability, predictable rendering, version control, and whether the Markdown behavior can be shared across applications instead of living inside one private editor.

Markdown extension work is easier to scale when commands, settings, and runtime behavior are documented and reusable. That is why package surfaces, renderer contracts, and explicit publishing boundaries matter so much in Markdown-heavy developer environments.

MdWrk connects well to this perspective because it treats Markdown as durable source while exposing renderer, editor, theme, extension, lander, and content-pack surfaces separately.
