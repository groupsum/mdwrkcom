Extensions let MdWrk describe additional workspace capabilities without turning the product into an unbounded runtime. The docs should explain what an extension can do, how it identifies itself, and how trust is represented.

## Manifest Metadata

The extension manifest is the first durable contract. It should describe identity, compatibility, capabilities, and package expectations in a way that can be reviewed before activation.

## Runtime Surface

Runtime surfaces may include panels, settings, commands, or workspace views. The documentation should connect these surfaces back to the local-first Markdown workflow rather than presenting extensions as unrelated widgets.

## Trust And Compatibility

Extension trust should be explicit. Users and operators need to understand which package is being used, what it can access, and whether the version is compatible with the current workspace.
