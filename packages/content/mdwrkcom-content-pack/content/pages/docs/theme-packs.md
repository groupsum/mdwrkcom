Theme packs describe how MdWrk presents the Markdown workspace without changing the underlying Markdown source. The documentation separates content, rendering, and theme behavior so users know what is styling and what is document data.

## Theme Contract

A theme should define visual tokens, layout behavior, syntax colors, and component styling boundaries. It should not rewrite public content or hide important text from crawlers and readers.

## Syntax Color

Code block syntax colors must be visible in generated HTML when the renderer emits token classes. Lander themes define different color variables for light and dark modes, while the static compiler keeps source content readable.

## Extension Relationship

Theme packs may be delivered through extension surfaces, but the documentation should explain which package owns the contract and how the workspace applies the visual layer.
