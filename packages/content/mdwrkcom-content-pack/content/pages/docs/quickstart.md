This quickstart explains the public MdWrk model before deployment. It does not depend on the production domain being live, and it does not require a client-side application shell to explain the product.

## Create Your First Document

Begin with a Markdown document and keep the source text readable. MdWrk treats Markdown as portable content, so the document should remain useful outside a single hosted service or proprietary editor state.

1. Create or open a Markdown file in the local workspace.
2. Add a title, short introduction, and at least one structured section.
3. Save the file as plain Markdown so the source remains portable.
4. Preview the rendered output before sharing or exporting.

## Preview The Result

Use preview to check headings, lists, links, code blocks, and document structure. The renderer is part of the package story, so public docs should describe the rendered result in terms that developers and authors can inspect.

## Understand Local Boundaries

MdWrk is described as local-first and privacy-first. That means the docs should explain what stays local, when export happens, when sync may contact an external service, and how extensions fit into the trust model.

## Continue Through The Docs

After this page, read the extension docs, theme pack docs, and comparison pages. The static lander generates HTML, Markdown mirrors, JSON-LD, sitemap data, robots policy, and LLM index files from the same content registry.
