`@mdwrk/markdown-renderer-react` gives React applications a package-level route into MdWrk-aligned Markdown rendering. It pairs with the renderer core package and keeps rendering behavior reusable outside the full workspace client.

Install:

```bash
npm install @mdwrk/markdown-renderer-react
```

Use this package when a product needs a React Markdown preview surface that can stay aligned with MdWrk examples, docs, and client behavior.

The React package is intentionally described as a reusable surface instead of a hidden implementation detail. That makes package adoption clear for teams that need preview behavior inside another application while keeping MdWrk-specific product positioning in the content pack.
