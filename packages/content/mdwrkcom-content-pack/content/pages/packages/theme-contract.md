`@mdwrk/theme-contract` defines theme token and compatibility contracts for MdWrk surfaces. It helps themes travel across editor, preview, extension, and lander experiences without patching private implementation details.

Install:

```bash
npm install @mdwrk/theme-contract
```

This package anchors the difference between reusable visual shape and MdWrk-specific styling truth. Product theme packs can supply identity while generic packages keep stable token names.

The contract matters for portability because themes should not depend on private app selectors. A product-specific theme can express its own visual system while editor, preview, extension, and lander packages continue to consume documented tokens.
