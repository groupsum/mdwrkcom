`@mdwrk/markdown-editor-react` provides React components for Markdown authoring. It is part of the package family that lets MdWrk behavior travel outside the main workspace client.

Install:

```bash
npm install @mdwrk/markdown-editor-react
```

Use this package when a product needs editor behavior directly and does not need to adopt the entire MdWrk application shell.

The editor package is part of the split package story. A consuming product can pair it with renderer packages, theme contracts, and its own content model while MdWrk continues to use the same family inside the flagship workspace.
