excerpt: Theme pack authoring uses MdWrk theme contracts, Theme Studio workflows, token exports, and package-ready surfaces for consistent editor and preview styling.
---

## Primary surface

Theme authoring in this repository centers on:

- `@mdwrk/theme-contract` for the formal token and bridge surface
- `@mdwrk/extension-theme-studio` for first-party theme authoring UX
- the shared editor and renderer package families that consume those tokens

## What Theme Studio proves

Theme Studio exists to prove that theme authoring can happen through the governed extension and token contracts instead of through app-local DOM patching.

The first-party theme authoring flow covers:

- inspecting formal theme tokens
- previewing token changes against editor and renderer surfaces
- applying and reverting draft changes
- exporting portable theme artifacts

## Authoring rules

Theme packs should target the shared contract directly.
They should not depend on application-local selectors or private client-only CSS assumptions.

That means a valid theme authoring workflow should preserve:

- contract-backed token names
- editor and renderer bridge compatibility
- reusable package independence from `apps/client/*` styling internals

## Package and artifact expectations

Theme authoring may produce:

- exported CSS aligned with the theme contract
- portable theme package scaffolds
- previewable artifacts that can be consumed by the host, editor, and renderer surfaces

## Quick Reference

Use this article to understand Theme Pack Authoring in the MdWrk Authoring surface. Theme Pack Authoring explains how this MdWrk surface works in the current client and package system.

Key concepts covered here:

- local Markdown files
- live preview
- extension host contracts
- theme portability
- developer package reuse

Use this path when you want to author portable MdWrk theme artifacts rather than only switch between built-in themes.
