## Offline Editing Model

The workspace stores documents in browser-managed local storage and IndexedDB-backed client state. The PWA install path can keep the client available in a dedicated app window while the editor keeps source text and preview close together.

## Writing Workflow

Use the editor-only view for focused drafting, split view for live validation, and preview-only mode for review. Formatting commands write portable Markdown instead of proprietary document state.

## Local Storage Boundary

MdWrk does not require documents to be uploaded to a hosted service before editing. Sync and export are intentional workflows, not hidden defaults.
