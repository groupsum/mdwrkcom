## Host Contract

The host exposes stable lifecycle and context contracts through extension packages. Extensions register commands, views, settings, and contributions through governed adapters instead of patching the client directly.

## Runtime Controls

The runtime handles activation, compatibility, persisted state, diagnostics, and trust policy enforcement. The manager extension gives users a visible operator console for installed extension behavior.

## First-Party Extensions

Current bundled surfaces include Extension Manager, Theme Studio, Language Pack Studio, Gemini Agent, Workspace Files, Git Operations, and catalog examples.
