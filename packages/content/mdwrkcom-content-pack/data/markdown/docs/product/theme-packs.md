## Theme Contract

Theme packs target shared tokens, bridge variables, and class names. This keeps theme behavior portable across the editor, renderer, host, and extension views.

## Theme Studio

The Theme Studio extension provides a first-party authoring workflow for inspecting tokens, previewing editor and renderer changes, applying draft values, reverting them, and exporting theme artifacts.

## Viewport Contract

Viewport and aspect-ratio breakpoints stay defined once in the client viewport contract. Themes can style each band, but they do not redefine the responsive taxonomy.
