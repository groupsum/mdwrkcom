excerpt: Screenshot evidence documents the MdWrk expectation that UI changes carry reviewable visual artifacts for affected themes, views, modes, panes, and modals.
---

## Evidence Scope

MdWrk UI work needs screenshot evidence for every affected view, mode, pane, modal, and theme. Responsive work also needs the governed aspect-ratio and viewport bands that apply to the changed surface.

The screenshot evidence contract applies to:

- `apps/client`
- `apps/desktop`
- the separate `mdwrk-com` site host repository
- first-party extension panes and settings
- rendered lander pages and reusable lander package surfaces

## Manifest Requirements

Screenshot evidence should be reviewable as files plus a manifest. The manifest should name the package owner, route or view, theme, mode, viewport band, and artifact path.

When a change does not alter visible rendering, the validator should say so by checking an explicit non-visual contract instead of silently skipping visual proof.
