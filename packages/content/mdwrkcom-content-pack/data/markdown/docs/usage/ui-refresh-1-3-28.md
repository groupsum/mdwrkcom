## Client update: `mdwrk/mdwrkspace` 1.3.28

This release improves editing ergonomics and cleans up key UI surfaces:

- Improved view-toolbar formatting grouping with a dedicated strikethrough convenience control.
- Nested markdown list marker rendering now shows only the deepest visible marker.
- Project selector cleanup and stronger border treatment for project/theme controls.
- Project delete confirmation modal upgraded for readability and action clarity.
- System Configuration modal sizing and spacing refined.
- System Configuration tab/pane labeling de-duplicated.
- Key mapping cards updated so command purpose + key binding remain legible at narrow widths.

## Notes

The viewport contract remains centralized in `apps/client/styles/base/viewports.css`; themes continue to style each breakpoint band independently.
