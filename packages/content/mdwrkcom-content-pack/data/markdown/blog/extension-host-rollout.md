## What extension authors get

MdWrk's extension platform includes:

- `@mdwrk/extension-manifest` for declarative metadata
- `@mdwrk/extension-host` for host-safe APIs
- `@mdwrk/extension-runtime` for activation and lifecycle
- `@mdwrk/extension-manager` for installation and management UX
- first-party surfaces for theme authoring, language packs, Git operations, and workspace files

## Installation and authoring references

These docs carry the current usage details:

- [Extension authoring guide](/docs/authoring/extensions)

## Package-first install example

```bash
npm install @mdwrk/extension-runtime @mdwrk/extension-host @mdwrk/extension-manifest
```

## Manifest example

```json
{
  "id": "acme.release-notes-tools",
  "name": "Release Notes Tools",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "publisher": "Acme",
  "engines": {
    "mdwrk": "^1.4.0"

This pane shows how MdWrk brings extension discovery and runtime management into the same workspace experience that writers and operators already use.

## Why this rollout matters

Extension teams want a host that communicates:

- where extensions register
- how compatibility is checked
- where settings and commands appear
- how first-party and third-party surfaces fit together

MdWrk now expresses that story clearly in product terms and package terms at the same time.
