title: Build with the Same MdWrk Editor and Renderer the Client Ships

excerpt: MdWrk packages its editor and renderer as reusable modules, giving product teams a direct path to embed the same authoring and preview surfaces the client uses every day.

## Why this matters

Reusable packages give teams a clear path to:

- ship MdWrk-powered editing inside internal tools
- reuse the same renderer in docs, apps, and examples
- keep extension work aligned with stable public package contracts
- move from first integration to broader adoption with a package set that already fits the live client

## What you can install today

The public package family starts here:

```bash
npm install @mdwrk/mdwrkspace @mdwrk/markdown-editor-react @mdwrk/markdown-renderer-react
```

These docs carry the current usage details:

- [Client installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [Standalone modules](/docs/getting-started/standalone-modules)
- [Local setup](/docs/getting-started/local-setup)

## React example

```tsx
import { MarkdownEditor } from '@mdwrk/markdown-editor-react';
import { MarkdownViewer } from '@mdwrk/markdown-renderer-react';
import { useState } from 'react';

export function MdWrkDemo() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('# Release Notes\n\nMdWrk packages travel well.');

  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'grid', gap: '1rem', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr' }}>
      <MarkdownEditor value={value} onChange={setValue} />
      <MarkdownViewer content={value} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This split-view surface shows the kind of install target product teams get when they adopt the package family directly.

## Repository history that shapes the package surface

The package move sits inside a broader history arc:

- [Standalone modules](/docs/getting-started/standalone-modules)
- [Extension platform](/docs/extensions/extension-platform)
- [Repository history for package alignment](https://github.com/groupsum/markdown_workspace/commits/master/?since=2026-03-23T00:00:00Z&until=2026-03-24T00:00:00Z)

## Who should use this package family

This package family fits:

- React application teams that want a markdown editor and renderer with a shared visual contract
- platform teams building governed docs or knowledge surfaces
- extension teams that want their work to sit close to the live MdWrk runtime

MdWrk turns package reuse into a practical adoption path, and this post marks the point where that path becomes easier to install, easier to use, and easier to extend.

## Article Guide

2026-03-23 marks this MdWrk product story: MdWrk packages its editor and renderer as reusable modules, giving product teams a direct path to embed the same authoring and preview surfaces the client uses every day.

This article is useful for readers tracking:

- how MdWrk changes affect daily Markdown writing
- which client, package, or extension surface the change touches
- where to continue in the product documentation after reading

Useful follow-up pages:

- [Local-First Markdown Workspace](/features/local-first-markdown-workspace)
- [Markdown Preview Editor](/features/markdown-preview-editor)
- [Editor Basics](/features/editor-basics)

MdWrk now ships a reusable package stack that product teams can install directly, wire into React, and extend through the same public surfaces that power the client.

This milestone is grounded in the March 23, 2026 packaging and naming run:
