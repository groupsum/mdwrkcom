## What this adds

This update brings together the details teams usually need first:

- How does the workspace verify package quality?
- Which docs stay current?
- Which commands carry release verification?

MdWrk now answers those questions through docs and executable CI rails.

## Commands that express the release story

```bash
npm run ci:workspace:verify
npm run conformance
```

## Docs to read next

- [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [Local setup](/docs/getting-started/local-setup)
- [Extension platform](/docs/extensions/extension-platform)

March 31 is where MdWrk gives teams a clearer view of:

- package verification
- release commands
- current docs
- package boundaries

It is a major point on the timeline because package usage, release checks, and public docs start moving together.
