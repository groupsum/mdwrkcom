## Why this matters for extension teams

A governed extension platform works best when it communicates:

- the host version it supports
- the tests that protect installation and runtime
- the UX where users manage extensions and settings

## Example compatibility-focused workflow

```bash
npm run test -w @mdwrk/extension-runtime
npm run test -w @mdwrk/extension-manager
npm run validate:compatibility
```
