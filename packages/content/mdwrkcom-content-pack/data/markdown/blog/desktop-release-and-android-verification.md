## Why this matters

This milestone gives teams a stronger answer to:

- how desktop builds move into release
- how Android artifacts are verified
- how version tags stay aligned with package state

## Commands that support the release path

```bash
npm run build:desktop:win
npm run ci:desktop:build
npm run ci:desktop:release
```
